This is a backport of the World of Warcraft battleground addon called REporter. ReporterLite was created for Project Ascension players. 
When you join a battleground, a moveable battleground map will appear on the screen, which has 5 clickable buttons below it, which allows 
the player to send a /bg message of your location, and the number of enemies headed to your location.

Extensive testing hasn't been performed. I would appreciate feedback. 

*DISCLAIMER*
Google Gemini AI was used for this and no code was written by myself.
